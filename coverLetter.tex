Dear Editor, \\\\
The symmetry of the superconducting order parameter in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ (SRO) remains a puzzle. 
Recently, time-reversal symmetry breaking $d_{x^2-y^2} \pm i g_{xy(x^2-y^2)}$ pairing was proposed as an order parameter candidate from a phenomenological standpoint to explain a wide variety of key experiments.
The stability of this state, especially of the $g$-wave component, in SRO is unclear. 
It was suggested that it may be stabilized by longer-range interactions based on studies of single-band Hubbard models.  However, a recent study (Ref.~27 in our paper) finds null results when extending this analysis to the SRO models. 
In this paper, we theoretically study the superconducting instabilities in SRO, including the effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), in the presence of both local and longer-range interactions within a random phase approximation. 
We show that the inclusion of second nearest neighbor repulsions, together with non-local SOC in the $B_{2g}$ channel or orbital-anisotropy of the non-local interactions, can have a significant impact on the stability of both $d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $g$-wave pairing channels. 
Accidentally / near degenerate $d_{x^2-y^2}+ig$ can be stable for a specific range of parameters.
We further analyze the properties, such as Knight shift and spontaneous edge current, of the realized $d_{x^2-y^2} + ig$ pairing and find that this state is more compatible with existing experimental measurements compared with the $s^{\prime}+id_{xy}$ and mixed helical pairing proposals. 
Our study identifies the key effects that stabilize higher-angular momentum pairing states in SRO, which can also be applied to other multi-band systems, and adds to our understanding of the pairing nature in SRO.
